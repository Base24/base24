# Roadmap

## Foreword

The intention of this project is as follows:
- Provide the means of creating one colour palette for multiple applications
- Provide templates for said applications
- To provide the means to combine those colours and templates to produce a
useable theme
- Provide the end user with easy access to these themes, so they can apply
them as needed
- Link to a number of these schemes and templates
- Convert a number of base16 schemes and templates to base24 schemes and
templates where beneficial (for example if a template has no need to use the
extended palette then it would be pointless to duplicate work)

Currently, Base24 has one participant. I would certainly encourage anyone who
wishes to contribute in any way to do so.


## Schemes

Popular schemes have the highest priority such as those used in popular terminal
themes

## Templates

any contributions are most welcome

### Help Wanted

I do not have sufficient knowledge on theming for this application/ theme for
this.

GTK Theming is a complete mess and given that I do not use it myself isn't
worth the time of trying to write CSS sheets for individual applications and the
theme as a whole. One option might be to find and replace colours but matured
projects seem a bit too complex for the scope of this project and simpler themes
end up looking wrong or breaking entirely. Help would certainly be appreciated
for these.
